# Ruby on Rails 5 Essential Training

Learn how to create full-featured, object-oriented
web applications with the latest version of the popular,
open-source Ruby on Rails framework. Ruby on Rails 5 
Essential Training covers the essential features of the
framework, along with best practices and real-world 
development techniques, resulting in a complete application
with dynamic, database-driven content. Follow along to 
build your own version of the example project, a data-driven
content management system, while you learn how to route 
browser requests, structure databases, render pages with 
dynamic content, process and validate form data, and configure
authentication. Instructor Kevin Skoglund, founder of web 
development agency Nova Fabrica, also introduces the design
 principles of CRUD and helps you master Rail's built-in helpers.
By the end of the course, you should be able to use Ruby on Rails 
to build robust web applications that are both easy to scale and maintain.
